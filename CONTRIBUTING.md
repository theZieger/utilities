## How do I contribute code?

1. Find some issue you're interested in, or a feature that you'd like to tackle.
  Also make sure that no one else is already working on it. We don't want you to be
  disappointed.

2. Fork, then clone

3. Create a branch with a meaningful name for the issue: `git checkout -b add-something`

4. Make your changes and commit: `git add` and `git commit`

5. Make sure that the tests still pass: `npm test`

6. Make sure you add/change tests while creating new features and/or fixing bugs

7. Push your branch: `git push -u origin your-branch-name`

8. Submit a pull request to the upstream utilitiesjs repository.

9. Choose a descriptive title and describe your changes briefly.

10. Wait for a maintainer to review your PR, make changes if it's being recommended, and get it merged.

11. Hooray!
